Kali Fresh Install Script

> Customize Kali as Quickly as Possible

I find myself often rebuilding Kali and re-installing the same exact tools for reversing and pwning. Kali is awesome and has a ton already built it, but this repo is simply automating that extra 10% so I do not have to do it myself all the time.

This script was built off a couple of other existing scripts (why start from scratch), mainly LiveOverFlow's Docker Example.
